# Mod Information
Mod version: 1.0.4
Game version: 0.21.27

# Vanilla Path +
Path makes you walk faster, and with [the other mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2829083798) I wrote, it makes you walk a lot faster ðŸ˜‰
So... it's normal that you would build your base full of path right? But with the current existing 5 paths, it is hard to match them with your base theme.
No worries! This mod will solve your issue! This mod added 11 more path, from stone brick path to dungeon path, all the floor you have, there is a path for it!

All the best in base building!

## Multiplayer
This mod needs to be downloaded for both host and client if playing in multiplayer.

## Important Notes:
- May the floor be with you... Wait, may the path be with you!
